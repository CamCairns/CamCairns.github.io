I'm a 'T'-shaped Data Scientist who loves developing, building and deploying data products and predictive models with an emphasis on delivery of end-to-end systems. Strong background in Python and *nix systems with day-to-day experience in SQL (Postgres, MemSQL, MonetDB), NoSQL (MongoDB), Spark, R, and Docker. Tend to use some combination of Bayesian Modelling (PYCM3), GBM's (XGBoost) and Neural Nets (PyTorch, Tensorflow) for machine learning problems. Also experience in Java, Ab Initio, and Tableau. 

I spend my time between Australia (Sydney, Melbourne), UK and mailand Europe. Open to contracting opportunities.
